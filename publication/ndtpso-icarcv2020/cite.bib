  abstract        = {This paper deals with the problem of simultaneous
                  localization and mapping (SLAM). Providing both accurate
                  environment's map and pose estimation is necessary to
                  correctly navigate, which is a key issue for a mobile robot
                  interacting with human beings. It is a line of research that
                  is always active, offering various solutions to this issue.
                  Nevertheless, among many SLAM methods, Normal Distributions
                  Transform (NDT) has shown high performances, where numerous
                  works have been published up to date and many studies
                  demonstrate its efficiency \$wrt\$ to other methods. In this
                  paper a new NDT based SLAM method using Particle Swarm
                  Optimization called NDT-PSO is proposed. The main contribution
                  is to invest the bioinspired approach PSO to solve pose
                  estimation problem based on iterative NDT maps. Real
                  experiments have been performed on a car-like mobile robot to
                  confirm the performances of NDT-PSO approach and its
                  efficiency in both static and dynamic environments.}
