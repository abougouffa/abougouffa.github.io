  abstract        = {Warehouses and industrial sites are getting more and more
                  interest in automating their workflow; in such an environment,
                  a robust localization method is required to accomplish safe
                  navigation indoors. One widely used scheme is the usage of
                  custom AGVs and dedicated infrastructures to automate moving
                  goods within the warehouse; however, such a solution needs to
                  modify the infrastructure or to make custom robots that fit
                  the existing infrastructure, which requires an important
                  investment. In this paper, we present and validate the
                  SmartTrolley, a generic, modular, and scalable experimental
                  platform for usage in warehouses and industrial sites; able to
                  localize itself in the environment using a scan matching and
                  EKF based indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
                  algorithm.}
