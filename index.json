Providing both accurate environment’s map and pose estimation is necessary to correctly navigate, which is a key issue for a mobile robot interacting with human beings. It is a line of research that is always active, offering various solutions to this issue. Nevertheless, among many SLAM methods, Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) has shown high performances, where numerous works have been published up to date and many studies demonstrate its efficiency wrt to other methods. In this paper a new NDT based SLAM method using Particle Swarm Optimization called NDT-PSO is proposed. The main contribution is to invest the bio-inspired approach PSO to solve pose estimation problem based on iterative NDT maps. Real experiments have been performed on a car-like mobile robot to confirm the performances of NDT-PSO approach and its efficiency in both static and dynamic environments.","tags":["Mobile robot","LiDAR","SLAM","NDT","PSO"],"title":"NDT-PSO, a New NDT based SLAM Approach using Particle Swarm Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdelhak Bougouffa","Emmanuel Seignez","Samir Bouaziz","Florian Gardes"],"categories":null,"content":"Note This work is part of an industrial project, the source code is not shared.

One widely used scheme is the usage of custom AGVs and dedicated infrastructures to automate moving goods within the warehouse; however, such a solution needs to modify the infrastructure or to make custom robots that fit the existing infrastructure, which requires an important investment. In this paper, we present and validate the _SmartTrolley_, a generic, modular, and scalable experimental platform for usage in warehouses and industrial sites; able to localize itself in the environment using a scan matching and EKF based indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm.","tags":["Mobile robot","Indoor Localization","LiDAR","Sensor Fusion","SLAM","NDT","PSO","EKF","SmartTrolley"],"title":"SmartTrolley: An Experimental Mobile Platform for Indoor Localization in Warehouses","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sometimes; when working with partimage, someone can create a backup of a 1TB partition which contains -for example- only 10GB of data; in this case, when we want to restore it, partimage will fail if the restore disk does not have enough space (1TB in this case).\nI faced this problem and here the trick I used to restore the backup image to a smaller disk image.\n Create an image file with the right size (with seek, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to actually have the whole space):  # Make sure that the seek=[SIZE] is sufficient dd if=/dev/zero of=disk_image.img bs=1 count=1 seek=1TB  Make the image looks like a disk, by making it as a loopback device.  sudo losetup /dev/loop0 disk_image.img  Restore the backup image to the loopback device.  sudo partimage restore /dev/loop0 backup.partimage.000  Done, now you can mount /dev/loop0 or delete the loopback device and mount the disk_image.img directly!  sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0 # delete loopback device mount disk_image.img /mount/point  This was a trick which I want to share with you.\n","date":1586995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586995200,"objectID":"89e93da81933a3cf5599174678862b6c","permalink":"https://abdelhakbougouffa.pro/post/restore-partimage-small-disk/","publishdate":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/restore-partimage-small-disk/","section":"post","summary":"Sometimes; when working with partimage, someone can create a backup of a 1TB partition which contains -for example- only 10GB of data; in this case, when we want to restore it, partimage will fail if the restore disk does not have enough space (1TB in this case).","tags":null,"title":"Restore a partimage to a smaller disk","type":"post"},{"authors":["Abdelhak Bougouffa","Anis Hocine"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497916800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497916800,"objectID":"f70dc551013adc0e9bd436215b233ba0","permalink":"https://abdelhakbougouffa.pro/publication/master-thesis-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/master-thesis-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This work deals with the localization and mapping problem of a car-like mobile robot in an unknown urban environment. The robot is equipped with a Sick LMS511 Pro laser sensor, the laser data are exploited to accomplish the task of localization and mapping. In such a situation, the two problems can not be dissociated, therefore, we propose to adopt a Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) approach. The developed solution is called NDT-PSO. It is based on the Normal Distribution Transformation (NDT) method and the Particulate Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. NDT is a SLAM method whose principle is to determine the geometric transformation between two successive laser scans using alignment techniques. Its representation of the environment is based on the modeling of the all 2D points reconstructed from a laser scan by a collection of local normal distributions. The PSO method is used in the transformation parameters optimization step , this parameters are used to determine the poses (positions and orientations) of the robot. The proposed algorithms are implemented on the Robot Operating System ROS using Python language and tested on the RobuCar mobile robot as part of an intelligent urban transport project.","tags":["Mobile robot","LiDAR","SLAM","NDT","PSO"],"title":"Contribution à la Localisation et la Cartographie Simultanées (SLAM) dans un Environnement Urbain Inconnu","type":"publication"}]
