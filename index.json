A rich literature has been invested in this direction, however, most of the proposed approaches lack fast convergence and simplicity regarding the optimization process, which should directly affect the accuracy of the environment’s map and the estimated pose. It is a line of research that is always active, offering various solutions to this issue. Among many SLAM methods, the normal distributions transform approach (NDT) has shown high performances, where numerous works have been published up to date and many studies demonstrate its efficiency wrt other methods. Nevertheless, few works have been interested to solve the optimization issue. The proposed solution is based on NDT scan-matching using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and it is dubbed NDT-PSO. The main contribution is to solve the pose estimation problem based on PSO and iterative NDT maps. The performances of the NDT-PSO approach have been proven in real experiments performed on a car-like mobile robot in both static and dynamic environments. NDT-PSO is tested for different swarm sizes, and the results show that 70 particles are more than enough to find the best particle while avoiding local minima even in loop closing. The algorithm is also suitable for real time applications, with an average runnnig time of 145ms for 70 particles and 70 iterations of the optimization process. This value can be further reduced using fewer particles and iterations. The accuracy of the proposed approach is also evaluated wrt other SLAM methods widely used among the robot operating system community and it has been shown that NDT-PSO outperforms these algorithms.","tags":["Mobile robot","LiDAR","SLAM","NDT","PSO"],"title":"Particle swarm optimization for solving a scan-matching problem based on the normal distributions transform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sara Bouraine","Abdelhak Bougouffa","Ouahiba Azouaoui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607558400,"objectID":"85b79285f080000727826df6dad385b8","permalink":"https://abdelhakbougouffa.pro/publication/ndtpso-icarcv2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ndtpso-icarcv2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper deals with the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

The robot is equipped with a Sick LMS511 Pro laser sensor, the laser data are exploited to accomplish the task of localization and mapping. In such a situation, the two problems can not be dissociated, therefore, we propose to adopt a Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) approach. The developed solution is called NDT-PSO. It is based on the Normal Distribution Transformation (NDT) method and the Particulate Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. NDT is a SLAM method whose principle is to determine the geometric transformation between two successive laser scans using alignment techniques. Its representation of the environment is based on the modeling of the all 2D points reconstructed from a laser scan by a collection of local normal distributions. The PSO method is used in the transformation parameters optimization step , this parameters are used to determine the poses (positions and orientations) of the robot. The proposed algorithms are implemented on the Robot Operating System ROS using Python language and tested on the RobuCar mobile robot as part of an intelligent urban transport project.","tags":["Mobile robot","LiDAR","SLAM","NDT","PSO"],"title":"Contribution à la Localisation et la Cartographie Simultanées (SLAM) dans un Environnement Urbain Inconnu","type":"publication"}]
